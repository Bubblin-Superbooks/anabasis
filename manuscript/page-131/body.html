The king, as it would appear, was himself quite taken aback by the advent of the army; as he fully showed by his proceedings next day.</p><p>During the progress of this night the Hellenes had their turn of scareâ€”a panic seized them, and there was a noise and clatter, hardly to be explained except by the visitation of some sudden terror.
